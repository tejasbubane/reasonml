# Grains

Calculate the number of grains of wheat on a chessboard given that the number
on each square doubles.

There once was a wise servant who saved the life of a prince. The king
promised to pay whatever the servant could dream up. Knowing that the
king loved chess, the servant told the king he would like to have grains
of wheat. One grain on the first square of a chess board. Two grains on
the next. Four on the third, and so on.

There are 64 squares on a chessboard.

Write code that shows:
- how many grains were on each square, and
- the total number of grains

## For bonus points

Did you get the tests passing and the code clean? If you want to, these
are some additional things you could try:

- Optimize for speed.
- Optimize for readability.

Then please share your thoughts in a comment on the submission. Did this
experiment make the code better? Worse? Did you learn anything from it?

## Building and testing
You will need the node package manager (npm) installed - download from [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
There is one time setup for each exercise, which may take a few minutes:
```
npm install
```

Open two shells, and in the first, start the build process.
```
npm start
```

In the second, start the tests running.
```
npm test
```

As you edit the code, the two processes will continually rebuild and rerun the tests.
